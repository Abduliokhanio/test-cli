Project Psudo-Code BluePrint
    1) Ask for user input for genre?
    2) Display Top 10 games in that genre.
    3) Ask user if he wants more information on a particular game?
    4) Display aditional information
    5) Ask user if he wants more information on a particular game?/ Give him option to go back to genre selection.
        5A) If user wants info on another game
            4 -> 5
        5B)If user wants info on another genre
            1 -> 5

Project Back-End

    Functionality
        The app is supposed to take information from the Steam Clearance section and display that information to the user
        based on what the user is looking for. 

        > It'll ask the user what Genre they want to look into and provide a top 10 list of games for that genre.
        > It'll allow the user to dive deeper and collecet more information on the games they are interested in based on the list they chose.

Building the Project

    The Ordinary World
        For the last couple of weeks due to the pandemic my life consisted of waking up, coding and sleeping,

    The Call To Adventure
        Something happens to upset the normal life of the hero, which often includes an invitation or pressure to leave their normal life behind.
        Luke buys a droid that plays a holographic distress call from Princess Leia and a plea for rescue. 

        But this particular Monday morning was different. We had discovered it was "CLI Project Week". It was the week we had all been preparing for 
        the last 2 months. And I still didnt have any Idea what My project was going to be about.

    Refusal Of The Call
        The hero resists, or tries to resist the inevitable.
        Luke clings to his commitment to his uncle and the farm. 

        At first I was planning on doing something easy. Something that required little effort. The original idea was that I'd build a web Scraper
        that used an api to list the Starbuck menu items.

    Meeting With The Mentor
        A wise person helps put things into perspective, encouraging the hero to accept the call to adventure.
        Enter Ben Kenobi. 

        Upon doing research to figure out how to use an API in my notes as well as checking on youtube. With the perifieril of my eye. I saw an interesting video thumbnail on the right 
        scroll in my youtube reccomandations. 
        By a youtuber named "carykh" with a vieo titled "Computer evolves to generate baroque music!"
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacogDL_4JU
        Through out the video "carykh" build an AI from scratch. And the video is about his multiple filures along the way and how much he 
        grew as a programmer towards the completion of the project.

    Crossing The Threshold
        The hero accepts the call to adventure, which propels them past the point of no return.
        The Lars Homestead is burned the ground and Luke leaves with Ben Kenobi. 

        The video lit a fire with in me. If "carykh" can build an AI from scratch with little to no experience. What stopping me from aiming 
        higher? It was then I decided that I wanted to build something of value. Somthing that other people would find useful in their lives.
        Not sure why. But the idea of building a project that listed the top 10 games on sale per genre from the steam library seemed like it would be 
        fun and enriching. And even more; it should be done in a week.

    Tests, Allies, And Enemies
        The hero’s resolve is tested and they meet friends and foes along the way.
        Luke and Ben are hunted by Stormtroopers and meet Han and Chewie. 

        Upon starting the project I googled the Steam Api to see if thery even had one. And lo and behold they did at least according to steam. 
        At first glace accoriding to a PDF file found on their website it seemed complicated and clunky to use. I became quickly overwelmed. What is a token? Why do I need it to
        access a Json file/Json data? And why is there no link for the API? I reached out to my friend Aurel who also just so happend to be doing a CLI project as well. One we were done 
        exchanging plesantries. I told him about my project and what its intended functionality was. And watching his eyes light up when I told him
        he would be able to get a list of the most popular games on sale whenever he wanted set off a flame of motivation in my chest. 

    The Approach
        The hero is trained or prepared for the mission they have accepted.
        Luke is trained in the ways of the force by Ben Kenobi and receives his first light sabre.

        The following day I opened up a "tinker.rb" file on my IDE and spent the whole day tinkering. Through trial and error I discovered that if I use "nokogiri" and
        "open-uri" I wouldn't have to use the steam API (which I could not actually find anyways). There I see the bridge to my success.
        I had access to all the data I needed to build a top 10 list.

    The Ordeal (The Cave)
        The hero is tested and often comes to their lowest point in the story.
        Luke and his friends are taken captive in the Death Star and nearly die in the trash compactor.

        That victory was short lived. After 2 whole days of coding. I discovered my actual programming file was corrupted. All my work was lost.
        And I only had 4 days left. Luckly I had remmebered the Algorythim for the most part and spent the entire day recreating it. But I still
        had to make an object to store the data, an object to display the data and figure out how to run the files with one command with an entire
        days worth of work lost. 

    The Reward
        The hero begins to rise with a victory in the bag.
        Luke and friends escape the Death Star with Princess Leia and just as critical, information about how to destroy the Death Star.

        With my newly rekindled flame of mitivation I set off to continue my journey. The same night I stayed up to 2am and I finished the 
        object meant to store my data. With an actual victory in the bag I decided to upload the project immidiatly to my git hub repository to 
        avoid any other setbacks.

    The Road Back
        The hero is forced to finish what they started by renewed opposition from the enemy.
        Darth Vader and the Death Star zero in on the Rebel Base, forcing the Rebels to launch an all-out assault on the Death Star.

        Three days left. I had to figure out how to display the objects based on user preferance. I opened up a "display.rb" file and went to work.
        The easy part was the 'puts' statement displaying the data. But how do I display data based on user prefereance? And how do I keep it going
        perminantly? After a couple hours on stack over flow I had realized that I needed a method that handled the logic. And after a brief
        revist of the 'trash.rb' file I had my 'logic' function up and running. Great now I can display the top 10 games on sale per genre from steam.


    The Resurrection
        The hero is tested again and nearly dies, but in such a way that they rise stronger than ever.
        Luke hears Ben Kenobi’s voice, uses the force, and delivers the death blow to the Death Star.

        Feels great to be done. But wait. I just realized I still need a way to dislplay information about the indiviudal games in my list.
        I need a way for my users to decide what genre they want to see a top 10 list for and what game they want to learn more about[description, developers, game reviews].
        No problem. Let me just check the website where I found the data for my top 10 list. Oh wait!!! That information isnt listed on the same webpage!
        Its listed on the indiviudal webpages for the game.

        I was about to quit and find an easier poject. When I saw another "carykh" thumbnail on youtube while procrastinating.
        I had remmebered why I set off on this quest.

    Return With The Elixir
        The hero returns home but life will never be the same.
        Luke is a hero but his training has just begun.
